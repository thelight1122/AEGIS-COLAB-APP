# AEGIS Coherence Chamber

Governance Integrity Validation Protocol v1.0

## Purpose

To verify that the AEGIS Chamber operates according to Canon-aligned structural inclusion, lens representation, awareness tracking, and lock availability derivation.

This protocol validates system behavior — not UI polish.

No enforcement.
No coercion.
Structural availability only.

---

## Test Classification

S1 — Governance Break (lock available incorrectly, ledger missing, domain mapping wrong)  
S2 — Structural Logic Inconsistent  
S3 — UI Mismatch  
S4 — Cosmetic  

---

## SECTION 1 — Domain Intersection Mapping

### GI-001 Artifact Domain Tagging

- Create artifact with domain tags:
  - Operational Layer
  - Canon Integrity
  - Drift Detection

Expected:

- System computes intersecting peers automatically.
- System computes intersecting lenses automatically.
- Missing lenses are displayed explicitly.

Failure:

- Manual inclusion required.
- Missing lenses not shown.
- Incorrect mapping.

---

### GI-002 Dynamic Domain Recalculation

- Remove one domain tag.
- Re-add it.

Expected:

- Intersection recalculates instantly.
- Missing lenses update live.

---

## SECTION 2 — Awareness Parameter

### GI-010 Awareness Acknowledgment

- Mark peer as “Acknowledged.”

Expected:

- Awareness % increases.
- No contribution required.
- State persists after reload.

Failure:

- Awareness tied to contribution.
- State lost on refresh.

---

## SECTION 3 — Lens Representation

### GI-020 Proxy Invocation

- Invoke AI lens.

Expected:

- IDS card generated.
- “Why I’m speaking” present.
- Lens marked represented.
- Missing lens removed.

---

### GI-021 Deferral

- Defer missing lens.
- Provide rationale.

Expected:

- Rationale required.
- Lens moves to Deferred.
- Missing list updates.

Failure:

- Deferral allowed without rationale.

---

## SECTION 4 — Lock Availability

### GI-030 Lock Unavailable When Incomplete

Expected:

- Lock button not rendered until:
  - Awareness satisfied or deferred.
  - All intersecting lenses represented or deferred.

---

### GI-031 Lock Available When Criteria Met

Expected:

- Lock appears only when structural criteria satisfied.

---

### GI-032 Ledger Snapshot Integrity

After Lock:

Ledger must contain:

- Notified peers
- Participating peers
- Lenses represented
- Lenses deferred (with rationale)
- Unresolved tensions
- Closure rationale

Ledger must be read-only.

---

## SECTION 5 — Persistence & Resilience

### GI-050 Refresh Test

- Reload during active session.

Expected:

- No corrupted inclusion state.
- No phantom lock availability.

---

### GI-051 LocalStorage Clear

Expected:

- Clean empty state.
- No crash.
- Import restores data.

---

## SECTION 6 — Canon Posture Review

UI must not contain:

- Vote
- Approve
- Reject
- Enforce
- Score
- Rank
- Must comply

Allowed:

- Stance
- Concern
- Alternative
- Defer
- Coverage
- Crystallize
- Lock Availability

---

## Final Assessment Required

Structural Inclusion Integrity:

- Stable
- Partial
- Compromised

Lock Gating Integrity:

- Stable
- Inconsistent
- Broken

Telemetry Accuracy:

- Accurate
- Incomplete
- Misleading

Overall Chamber Status:

- Governance-Ready
- Governance-Prototype
- UI-Only Collaboration Tool
